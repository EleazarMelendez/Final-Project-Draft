            Yet most of what we hear about from the far corners of the globe
            comes in through a limited lens, filtered by news editors, search
            platforms or social media algorithms. Those information gate-keepers
            present us only a small view of the world that they have calculated
            the reader would want to read about -- a skewed picture of reality.{" "}

            Using natural language processing tools and artificial intelligence,
            this tool seeks to unskew that bias, presenting a summary of the
            news as they are being reported in each country's newspapers,
            instead of how they are being filtered by American editors.<br></br>

            This tool aggregrates data from hundreds of news sites across the
            world, treating the content obtained from each one without fear or
            favor. But that doesn't mean all content is equal, or that the
            source sites do not suffer from bias <br></br>

            More specifically, this site draws information from mass media
            sources in country's known to pose oppressive conditions for
            journalists, where national governments either control, unduly

            <br></br>
            As such, this tool strives to present how news are being presented
            to audiences across the world, but makes no claims as to the
            accuracy of those news.
